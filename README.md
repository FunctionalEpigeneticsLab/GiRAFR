# GiRAFR (Guide RNA Aberrations and Functionality Revealed)

GiRAFR is a python package 

# Introduction

The script first generates coordinates based on input window size, and reference sequence and later they are used by Samtools to split alignment file (bam file) into bam files which contain reads that aligned to window region. FeatureCount from UMI-tools is employed to filter out reads that not align properly to this target gene. Consensus sequences are generated by union reads within detection window with the same UMI and cell barcode. Reference sequence for each region is compared with the consensus sequence to identify mutations. Deletions that pass cutsite are defined as editing effect.
